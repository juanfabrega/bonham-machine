# Bonham Drum Machine
A drum machine with John Bonham samples. Built with vanilla JS.

# Background
This project is part of the Javascript 30 developer challenge to build 30 small apps in 30 days using ONLY vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks and no boilerplate. 

I've always been a huge Led Zeppelin fan, so the idea of building a drum machine appealed to me but only if it was done with samples taken straight from John Bonham's playing.

# Future Goals
I'd like to augment this project with a few simple additions:
* mobile support so users can tap on buttons rather than using their keyboard.
* selection of samples from various Led Zeppelin songs.
